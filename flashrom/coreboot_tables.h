/* The coreboot table information is for conveying information
 * from the firmware to the loaded OS image.  Primarily this
 * is expected to be information that cannot be discovered by
 * other means, such as querying the hardware directly.
 *
 * All of the information should be Position Independent Data.  
 * That is it should be safe to relocated any of the information
 * without it's meaning/correctness changing.   For table that
 * can reasonably be used on multiple architectures the data
 * size should be fixed.  This should ease the transition between
 * 32 bit and 64 bit architectures etc.
 *
 * The completeness test for the information in this table is:
 * - Can all of the hardware be detected?
 * - Are the per motherboard constants available?
 * - Is there enough to allow a kernel to run that was written before
 *   a particular motherboard is constructed? (Assuming the kernel
 *   has drivers for all of the hardware but it does not have
 *   assumptions on how the hardware is connected together).
 *
 * With this test it should be straight forward to determine if a
 * table entry is required or not.  This should remove much of the
 * long term compatibility burden as table entries which are
 * irrelevant or have been replaced by better alternatives may be
 * dropped.  Of course it is polite and expedite to include extra
 * table entries and be backwards compatible, but it is not required.
 */

/* Since coreboot is usually compiled 32bit, gcc will align 64bit 
 * types to 32bit boundaries. If the coreboot table is dumped on a 
 * 64bit system, a uint64_t would be aligned to 64bit boundaries, 
 * breaking the table format.
 *
 * lb_uint64 will keep 64bit coreboot table values aligned to 32bit
 * to ensure compatibility. They can be accessed with the two functions
 * below: unpack_lb64() and pack_lb64()
 *
 * See also: util/lbtdump/lbtdump.c
