/*
 * map_create()  create a new map (associative array)
 * map_copy()    copy map src to map dest
 *               dest must be a larger map than src
 *               Note that this function also copies the member cmp_key.
 * map_put()     put object in map under key
 *               Callers should always reset the passed map pointer with
 *               the one this function returns. This is necessary in case
 *               the map had to be resized.
 * map_get()     get object from map stored under key
 *               returns NULL if there is no object with key in map
 * map_del()     remove the object stored under key from map
 * map_dump()    display the current contents of map
 * 
 * The value MAP_FREE_KEY is reserved as a special key value. Don't use that
 * value.
