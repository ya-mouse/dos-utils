 * Normally, the code that uses a dynamic library knows what it wants,
 * i.e., it searches for specific symbol names. So, for a program that
 * uses a DXE the code could look something like:
 *
 * void *handle         = open_module (MODULE_NAME);
 * int (*function)(int) = ((strruct st_symbol_t*) handle)->function;
 *
 * However, by adding a symbol loading function, st_symbol_t doesn't have
 * to be updated if the DXE should export more or other symbols, which
 * makes using a DXE less error prone. Changing st_symbol_t would also
 * require a recompile of the code that uses the DXE (which is a *bad* thing).
 * A symbol loading function also makes an "extension API" a bit more elegant,
 * because the extension functions needn't be hardcoded in st_symbol_t;
