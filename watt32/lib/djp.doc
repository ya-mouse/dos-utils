                          executable file compressor

                                 for DJGPP V2

                                 version 1.05

 What is It?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    DJP is a fast and small executable file compressor for files produced by
 DJGPP V2. It uses an algorithm called LZO1X, which achieves an average
 compression ratio of about 0.56 on executable files, and can decompress
 at about 6-8 Mbytes/sec on an AMD 486DX4-100 with no memory overhead.
 (Decompression speed is defined as uncompressed size/decompression time.)


 How to Install?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    If you have the binary distribution:

        unzip mlp105b.zip     or   pkunzip -d mlp105b.zip

    If you have the source distibution:

        unzip mlp105s.zip     or   pkunzip -d mlp105s.zip
        cd contrib\djp\src
        unzip lzo.zip         or   pkunzip -d lzo.zip
        move lzo-0.24 lzo     or   mv lzo-0.24 lzo
        make


 How to Use?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Simply type:

                  DJP [options] <filename> [<filename list>]

    Use the -d option to decompress files.
    Use the -t option to check the integrity of compressed files.
    Use the -l option to list the compression ratio.

    Use the -b option to keep backup files.
    Use the -s option to put the decompressor into the stub.
    Use the -c option to produce COFF output.
    Use the -1 option for the fast (and worse) compressor.
    Use the -q option for quiet mode.
    Use the -h option for command line help.
    Use the -0 option to ignore the default options (see below).

    <filename> can be a stubbed .EXE or a stubless COFF image.
    You can use wildcards too.


 Stubbed vs. stubless decompressor
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Since DJP 1.04 there is a new feature: the stubless decompressor. Here are
    the main differences between the stubbed and the stubless one.
    
    Stubbed
    -------

    + simple self check against viruses
    ñ you can't debug the compressed files :-)
      (at least not with the standard DJGPP tools)
    - alters stubinfo: so if some of your (un)compressed files were stubedited,
      you must stubedit them after the (de)compression again
    - if you have "symbolic links" to a compressed file, than you have to
      replace all the links with djpstub.exe.

      So if you compress grep.exe, then you should replace egrep.exe and 
      fgrep.exe.

                    DJP -s grep.exe

                    copy djpstub.exe egrep.exe
                    stubedit egrep.exe runfile=grep

                    copy djpstub.exe fgrep.exe
                    stubedit fgrep.exe runfile=grep

      Or you can use DJPLINKS.BAT (it's in the /bin directory).

    Stubless
    --------

    + works with the PMODE/DJ stub 
    + works with debuggers (but you won't have debug info!!)
    + no problems with "symbolic links"
    + doesn't alter stubinfo.

 
 Default options
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    You can change the default options for DJP 1.05 through an environment
    variable called DJP_OPTIONS. You can do this with a SET DJP_OPTIONS= 
    statement in your autoexec.bat or via the DJGPP.ENV file. If you choose
    the latter method, just add a section to your DJGPP.ENV:
    
    [djp]
    DJP_OPTIONS=your favorite options for DJP  (-s,-b,-c,-q)
    
    For example if you don't like the progress indicator, and always want
    to keep the backup files, then set
    
    DJP_OPTIONS=qb
    
    After this, the -q and the -b option will have the opposite meaning if
    you use them on the command line. -b will delete the backup files, and 
    -q will show the progress indicator. Type DJP -h if you wanna see the
    actual state of the options (dynamic command line help :-)
